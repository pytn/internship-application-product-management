## **_Mock Press Release_**

SAN FRANCISCO, APRIL 20, 2020 -- Today, Cloudflare, a leader in website security and cloud infrastructure, announced new capabilities in its Cloudflare for Workers environment. Today, analysts must keep tedious manual records of attempted security breaches, lags, profits, and other difficulties relating to game launch and maintenance. However with Cloudflare’s ROI Dashboard, analysts can now quickly identify actions that are the most critical in supporting the security of their applications by utilizing the insights that ROI dashboard provides them, rather than spending their time generating the insights themselves and subsequently combing through the data, which is especially challenging during critical periods like the launch of an application.

“Using Cloudflare for Gaming’ closed loop platform, we were able to identify key areas for improvement based on security and scalability insights from the dashboard. This process has increased our ROI due to the fact that we have a more systematic way of identifying actions and features that will provide the most necessary and tangible improvements to our business.” said Justin Ferris, Director of Global Security Operations at Blizzard Entertainment, “The insights generated by Cloudflare’s ROI Dashboard are valuable in that they make it clear where we need to focus our efforts.”


## **_Business Value_**

Because a lot of what Cloudflare does goes unseen, we need to put a monetary value on the silence and prioritize customer retention by highlighting our strong ROI rather than striving solely to increase our customer base. This is an opportunity for Cloudflare to differentiate itself from other members of the Bandwidth Alliance, and even other serverless gaming backend platforms. There are no known gaming platforms that provide a risk assessment and data collection feature like this one, and the ROI Dashboard is a great opportunity for us to leverage our platform capabilities to maintain and better serve our user base.


## **_Success Metrics_**

We want to see that: 



*   Customers who use the ROI calculator are twice as likely to renew yearly as customers that are not using it are 
*   Customers that are not using a feature are 20% or more likely to contact a Cloudflare sales rep after seeing it in the dashboard
*   25% of CF for Gaming customers end up adding additional features to their contract within 12 months [Upsell Opportunity] 

Data that needs to be gathered each time Cloudflare for Gaming is Run:



*   Number of instances of DDoS attacks stopped by Cloudflare
*   Dates of instances of DDoS attacks stopped by Cloudflare
*   Number of users on the application 
*   Revenue Earned 

Data that customers need to input in order to generate complete insights:



*   Historical launch data (crashes, attacks, amount of users in the first week, past revenue)
*   Launch dates (potential, previous or otherwise)


## **_Priorities for the ROI Dashboard_**



*   [P0]  The ROI Dashboard has to have a calculator which customers can use to manually input data (such as how many DDos attacks were successfully stopped by Cloudflare, how many users joined during the launch, etc.) that spits out data points such as revenue earned and the amount of revenue loss prevented \
 
*   [FUTURE] [P1] Instead of relying on manual input, the ROI Dashboard will automatically pull relevant information from customer account usage and table the data accordingly
*   [FUTURE] [P2] We can predict based on previous monthly reports what future Cloudflare usage will look like monetarily (Will the ROI remain the same, increase or decrease with time? Are the customer’s launch sizes increasing, thus increasing their need for bandwidth?)
*   [Future] [P3]  We can calculate need for additional bandwidth, based on aggregated game launch data and offer launch specific packages/pricing that can account for usership drop off and an increase in DDoS attacks during the first four hours of a game making its debut (the most critical, busy period of the launch)


## **_Risks_**



*   ROI Calculator users with lower instances of DDoS attacks might pay for less features
    *   It is possible that some users might choose to stop using Cloudflare for Gaming entirely, having assessed that their ROI is low
*   Our forecasts might not always pan out, potentially irritating customers that feel they might have overpaid for unnecessary bandwidth
